# UF Marketplace (Final Name TBD)
UF student marketplace platform project for CEN5035 - Software Engineering. Our application is intended to be a platform for students at the University of Florida to exchange goods and services. Users will ideally be able to upload listings, search and view existing listings using filters/categories, access a dashboard view to manage their posts, and possibly engage in real-time messaging with sellers. Users will need to sign up with their ufl email.
