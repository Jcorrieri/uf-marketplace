## What We Planned

We planned to implement the login page, signup page, and corresponding backend functionality. This solves several of the user stories, whose specific issues can be found on the github page. 

## What We Did

We successfully implemented the frontend pages for both the login and signup page, as well as drafted a mock homepage. On the backend side, we successfully set up a framework for development, which can be viewed on the github repository, and we created a model for the users, developed basic CRUD operations, got a working registration endpoint, and are partially through completing the login endpoint.

## What We Didn't Do

We did not fully finalize the backend endpoint for logging in, and are still working through style changes for the frontend. This was due to time constraints, and a lack of foundation for the authentication code. Additionally, we had some conflicts over the direction of the project and certain styling options, such as whether to use MaterialUI or not. The corresponding issues can be seen on our github page.
